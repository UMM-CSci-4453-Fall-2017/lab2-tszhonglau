Relationship
Sales interacts with inventory, every time an item is sold, it should reflect that in the inventory.
total_sale interacts with sales, it takes the amount of the products sold times the price of the product and add the total amount to total sale.
Cost interacts with sales, employee and timesheet, every time a product is sold it takes the cost of the product. It also takes the amount that the employee worked, times the amount they make.
